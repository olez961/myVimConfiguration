# myVimConfiguration

This repo is for chinese friends who has trouble to directly connect github and download some vim plug.

By follow the auto-config tutor below, you'll be able to auto config your vim like this repo.

Something rediculous is that I now realize that I should put this repo in the gitee, interesting.

## The plug management

I use the vim-plug to manage my vim plugs, reference from [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17L411c7Eu).

## The plug I have already installed

They are listed below:
1. gruvbox, comfortable theme;
2. nerdtree, press I(big i) or ";g"(combination key) to  show me the dirs tree;
3. vim-airline, show me the status line of vim;
4. indentLine, control the tab length.
