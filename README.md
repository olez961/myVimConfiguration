## The plug management

I use the vim-plug to manage my vim plugs, reference from [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17L411c7Eu).

## The plug I have already installed

They are listed below:
1. gruvbox, comfortable theme;
2. nerdtree, press I to show me the dirs tree;
3. vim-airline, show me the status line of vim.
